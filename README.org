* shy
  A (hopefully) handy tool for inspecting bash scripts.

  The inspiration for such a tool partly comes from =guild= program
  that is shipped with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][GNU Guile]].

** Usage

*** Print script commentary
    A script commentary is a part of the script between those strings:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
### Commentary:

# (Commentary)

### Code:
#+END_EXAMPLE

    You can print this section as follows:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ shy commentary <script>
$ shy c <script>            # Shorthand
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Print script copyright
    Print copyright section from a script:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ shy copyright <script>
$ shy C <script>            # Shorthand
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Print dependencies
    Print script dependencies, that is, scripts that are sourced in
    the given script:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ shy deps <script>
$ shy d <script>            # Shorthand
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Inspect a script
    *NOTE* that this is HIGHLY experimental feature.

    Inspect a script for potentially problematic and/or obsolete
    things:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ shy inspect <script>
$ shy i <script>            # Shorthand
#+END_EXAMPLE
